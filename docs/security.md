Designing applications to *depersonalise* or *segregate users from their data* is an advanced safety and privacy strategy—particularly valuable in applications where data sensitivity is high (e.g. finance, health, communications). If your site is compromised, these strategies can help prevent attackers from easily mapping user identities to sensitive data.

Here are **strategic design patterns** to achieve this:

---

## 🔐 1. **Use Pseudonymous Identifiers Instead of PII**

Replace personal identifiers (email, name, phone) with opaque, random identifiers (UUIDs) in all internal relationships.

* ✅ Instead of: `Transaction.userId = user.email`
* 🔒 Do: `Transaction.userId = "1f72ae80-f2c0-11ec-b939-0242ac120002"`

### Benefits:

* Compromised records can't be easily linked back to specific users without an internal lookup table.
* PII can be stored in a separate, more strictly guarded table.

---

## 🧱 2. **Data Tokenization / Data Vault Architecture**

Separate PII from behavioral/transactional data by using a **data vault or tokenization service**.

### Example:

* Table A: `users` → contains real `email`, `name`
* Table B: `vault_links` → maps `user_id` → `token_id` (secure, internal use only)
* Table C: `transactions` → only refers to `token_id`

This makes it hard for attackers who gain access to the transactional DB to identify users without also breaching the vault.

---

## 🏷️ 3. **Encrypt PII at Rest and Use Field-Level Encryption**

Even if attackers exfiltrate the database, field-level encryption of PII makes the data less useful.

* Encrypt names, emails, and phone numbers with a **separate key** from disk encryption.
* Decrypt only when needed (e.g. for email sending).

```ts
// On write
user.email = encrypt(email, piiKey);

// On read
decrypt(user.email, piiKey);
```

Use different encryption keys for different users or key rotation policies to minimize blast radius.

---

## 🌐 4. **Isolate User Data Per Tenant (Multi-Tenant Isolation)**

If you support multiple users or groups, you can isolate their data using:

* Separate schemas (e.g., `user1.transactions`)
* Separate databases
* Strict access scoping (e.g., `WHERE tenant_id = X`)

This makes lateral movement harder in case of compromise.

---

## 🧩 5. **Don’t Log or Cache PII**

Avoid logging:

* Auth headers
* Query params with names/emails
* User-submitted data

Also, disable caching (server/client) for pages with PII:

```http
Cache-Control: no-store
```

---

## 📤 6. **Use Blind Indexing for Searchable PII**

If you need to search (e.g. by email), don’t store or index plaintext. Use a **blind index** (HMAC) that allows searching without revealing actual values.

```ts
searchIndex = hmac(email, searchKey); // Safe to index
```

---

## 🔄 7. **Anonymisation of Historical Data**

For analytics, consider **batch anonymisation**:

* Strip out or generalise user references
* Replace email with `user_1`, `user_2`, etc.
* Aggregate over groups

---

## 🔓 8. **One-Way Identifiers for Shared Links**

If generating public or semi-public links, don’t expose database IDs.

* Use signed tokens or hashed identifiers:

  * `/share/rec-9fd2d823-fd7e` ✅
  * Avoid: `/share/record/1234` ❌

---

## 🔒 9. **Role-Based Data Minimisation**

Enforce *least privilege* access:

* Backend APIs should only return fields the client needs.
* Admins should only be able to see PII if absolutely required.

---

## 💡 10. **Audit Trails and Breach Alerting**

If a mapping is accessed too frequently or data is joined unusually, raise alerts.

* E.g. more than N lookups of user ID to email in a short time

---

### 🧠 Bonus: Security-In-Depth Considerations

* Use **content security policy** (CSP) to avoid client-side data leaks.
* Require **re-authentication** for sensitive operations (downloading user data).
* Store mapping keys (PII ↔ ID) in **separate secure infrastructure** (e.g., HSM or KMS-protected service).
